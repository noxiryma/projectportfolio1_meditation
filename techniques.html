        <h4>Getting Started</h4>
        <p>Relax... Meditation comes in many forms and reeps benefits to the practitioner.
            To start, find a quiet place with little distraction for you to dedicate your time for your meditation.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is normal for the mind to wander at the beginning of your journey. Be patient with yourself and think of it as a marathon and
            not a sprint. You wouldn't run a marathon without training first so think of your meditation as training for the
            longer practices in the future.
            <br>
            <br>
            See our <a href="postures.html" id="postures-link">postures</a> page for recommendations on how to make yourself
            comfortable for your practice.
            <br>
            <br>
            Below are some options to help you choose which one is best for you and your practice. You can also vary your
            pratice by changing your technique.

                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>It is exactly what it sounds like. During this practice you will be focussing your 
                attention on something other than your thoughts. Your mind will naturally wander so this method is a good
                practice to help bring the attention back to focussing on something other than distracting thoughts.</p>

                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>The focus meditation also know as Samatha or focussed attention meditation (FAM) in some practices 
                    is a practice where the practitioner focusses the attention on a thought, sound, sensation or object of their choosing.
                    An early example of this is the fire gazing meditation mentioned previously on this website. 
                    Another good practice where if the mind wanders the practitioner can bring the attention back to their chosen 
                    focus for this meditation.

                <p>In your comfortable meditation posture with eyes closed and after your conditioning. Have a lit candle
                    placed in front of you. Without damaging your sight gently focus your gaze on the flame for the 
                    duration of your practice. If the mind wanders, bring your focus back to the candle. 
                </p>
                <h6>Sensation</h6>
                <p>In your comfortable meditation posture with eyes closed and after your conditioning. Bring your attention to 
                    the sensation of the contact of your body with the floor and with the feeling of your breath moving in your 
                    body.

                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>Noting or mental noting is a technique used to help the practitioner notice and let go of distractions 
                    by practicing awareness of thoughts, sensations and sounds that have caused the practitioner to lose 
                    focus. The meditator can then give these a label to help them recognise and develop a method of 
                    detachment from distracting thoughts, sensations and sounds. 
                </p>

                    <li>Develops a deeper awareness of the mind</li>
                    <li>Healthy detachment from distractions</li>

            </div>
            <div id="techniques-text">  
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>In your comfortable meditation posture with eyes closed and after your conditioning. Bring your attention
                    to your breath as your focus for your meditation. When you hear a sound make a mental note with the word 
                    "sound". When you have a thought make a mental note with the word "thought". When you notice a sensation
                    in your body make a mental note with the word "sensation". Try not to let the things you notice become a
                    distraction as you will lose focus but try to bring yourself back to focussing on your breath after you
                    have made a mental note.
