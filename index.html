        <h3>The Roots of Meditation</h3>
        <p>Meditation comes from the Latin term "to ponder" and is used as an umbrella term for a variety of practices. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Some of which are demonstrated on this website on the <a href="techniques.html">techniques</a> page. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The origin of meditation has been debated for years and has been argued to have started at the beginnings of our beings 
            with fire gazing meditation to be one of the first practiced 200,000 years ago. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The practices were passed on orally before being commited
            to writing. The earliest written records appear in the Hindu Vedas around 1500 BCE but they were believed to have been 
            practiced since 3000 BCE.
            <br>
            <br>
            From Meditation came mindfulness meditation.

            As you can see from the benefits above Meditation is not a selfish practice but a selfless one too. Plus it doesn't 
            have to be practiced alone. 
            <br>
             The benfits of joining a group meditation are building a habit of attending, having a dedicated teacher at each practice,
             sharing your experience with others, the physical and mental health benefits of being involved in a social group. 
             <br>
             Studies have also shown the ripple effect of practing your meditation in a peaceful environment surrounded by a group of 
             likeminded people.
