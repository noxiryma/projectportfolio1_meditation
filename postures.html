            <h4>Introduction to Postures</h4>
            <p>The iconic crossed legged sitting position of meditation carries behind it great meaning but the 
                origin of the meditation position is something very simple; this is how the practitioners
                were sat when they practiced meditation. 
                Even though this makes your meditation position sound unimportant. An uncomfortable position 
                versus a comfortable one makes all the difference on how your practice goes. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Buddha recommended sitting in one of four positions for meditation. 
                These are: standing, sitting, lying down and walking. Below we have described how it is best to 
                implement 3 of these postures and their variations. Experiment with each posture until you find one 
                that best serves you.  
                <br>
                <br>
                There are also a number of props that can be used to support the body for holding postures 
                for a longer period of time with minimal effort and making it accesible to everybody. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What is important is that with each posture is that you find balance between being calm and alertness.
                Keeping the spine straight has been proven by science to help find this balance and mental clarity.

                <h4>Conditioning</h4>
                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>Conditioning is an exercise that is good to practice before you start your meditation practice. It 
                    helps you arrive in the space, the breath, the posture and sometimes with an intention you set for 
                    your practice. It is a good way to prepare yourself to declare that you have set this time aside for 
                    yourself to practice your meditation. 
                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>In your chosen meditation posture with the eyes open find a soft focus on an unmoving point. 
                    Take a big inhale through the nose and feel your abdomen expand; exhale fully through the mouth. Repeat 
                    twice and then let the breath return to normal. Gently close the eyes and relax the shoulders. Slightly 
                    tuck the chin to the chest and feel the rest of your body relax into the posture. Now begin your 
                    meditation practice.
