            <h4>Introduction to Postures</h4>
            <p>The iconic crossed legged sitting position of meditation carries behind it great meaning but the 
                origin of the meditation position is something very simple; this is how the practitioners
                were sat when they practiced meditation. 
                Even though this makes your meditation position sound unimportant. An uncomfortable position 
                versus a comfortable one makes all the difference on how your practice goes. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The Buddha recommended sitting in one of four positions for meditation. 
                These are: standing, sitting, lying down and walking. Below we have described how it is best to 
                implement 3 of these postures and their variations. Experiment with each posture until you find one 
                that best serves you.  
                <br>
                <br>
                There are also a number of props that can be used to support the body for holding postures 
                for a longer period of time with minimal effort and making it accessible to everybody. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What is important is that with each posture is that you find balance between being calm and alertness.
                Keeping the spine straight has been proven by science to help find this balance and mental clarity.

                <h4>Conditioning</h4>
                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>Conditioning is an exercise that is good to practice before you start your meditation practice. It 
                    helps you arrive in the space, the breath, the posture and sometimes with an intention you set for 
                    your practice. It is a good way to prepare yourself to declare that you have set this time aside for 
                    yourself to practice your meditation. 
                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>In your chosen meditation posture with the eyes open find a soft focus on an unmoving point. 
                    Take a big inhale through the nose and feel your abdomen expand; exhale fully through the mouth. Repeat 
                    twice and then let the breath return to normal. Gently close the eyes and relax the shoulders. Slightly 
                    tuck the chin to the chest and feel the rest of your body relax into the posture. Now begin your 
                    meditation practice.

                <h4>Seated on the Floor</h4>
                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>
                    The seated posture is one used in many meditation practices due to it keeping the practitioner balanced 
                    between calm and alert. It is a good starting position as props can be used to help make the position 
                    more comfortable.
                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>
                    In this meditation posture you sit directly on the floor with legs crossed or kneeling. Keep the spine straight 
                    and the shoulders relaxed. 
                    Hands placed with the palms facing up resting on top of the knees or thighs. 
                    Try to keep the curve in the lower back from rounding as this will cause back pain. 
                </p>
                <h5>Variations</h5>
                <p>Your knees should not be above the hips in this position, if they are you may need to sit on a cushion. You can 
                    sit with your back against a wall to start with a rolled up blanket at the curve of your lower back. You can also 
                    sit on a chair with your feet placed on the ground.

            <div class="postures-text-right">
                <h4>Lying Down</h4>
                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>A beneficial posture for those who find discomfort in a sitting posture even with the added props 
                    for support. This posture is also used in lengthy meditations where discomfort or pain after a long 
                    period of time is more likely. There is the risk of this posture leading to sleep during the meditation. 
                </p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>Lying down on a comfortable surface let the legs extend long with the feet relaxed falling outwards. Have 
                    the arms extended along the sides of the body with the shoulder blades slightly tucked down the back so the 
                    palms are facing upwards. 
                </p>
                <h5>Variations</h5>
                <p>If there is any lower back discomfort bend your knees and have your feet placed on the floor. You can also place 
                    a rolled up blanket underneath the knees with legs extended. Hands can be placed on the torso, palms facing down
                    if having them on the floor is uncomfortable.

            <div class="postures-text-left">
                <h4>Standing</h4>
                <h5>What is it?</h5>
                <p>Standing meditation is the most active of the postures and is a good choice if you struggle with staying
                    awake during the lying down posture or you suffer pain in any sitting postures.</p>
                <h5>Method</h5>
                <p>It is better to do this posture without shoes on. Start by creating your foundation with your feet. Lift all 10 toes 
                    off the ground, spread them out and then release them back to the ground. Stand with your knees slightly bent. Roll 
                    the shoulders up towards the ears and down the back so they stay relaxed and your chest becomes open. Arms are dropped 
                    to the sides  of the body with palms and elbow creases facing forwards. Slightly tuck the chin and 
                    the tailbone up towards your navel. 
                </p>
                <h5>Variations</h5>
                <p>If standing becomes uncomfortable try walking whilst doing your meditation. 
                </p>

            <div class="postures-text-right">
                <h4>Props</h4>
                <h5>What are they?</h5>
                <p>Props are useful pieces of equipment that can be invested in as your meditation practice grows to be used
                    to help make your meditation posture more comfortable and lead to longer practices. 
                </p>
                <h5>Types of Props</h5>
                <p>Sitting positions can be practiced on a bolster or cushion. There are specific cushions designed as meditation
                    seats and other cushions that can be placed on the floor to make the contact with the knees on the ground more
                    comfortable. 
                    Bolsters can be used to sit on in the kneeling position with the bolster placed lengthways between your legs as 
                    you sit on it. They can also be placed under the knees in the lying down position to alleviate any lower back 
                    discomfort by making it flat to the ground.
